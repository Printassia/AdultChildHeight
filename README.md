# Adult Child Height

One way to estimate the adult height of a child is to use the following formula,
which uses the height of the parents:

Hmale_child = ((Hmother * 13/12) + Hfather) / 2

Hfemale_child = ((Hfather * 12/13) + Hmother) / 2

All heights are in inches. Write a program that takes as input the gender of the child, the height of the mother in inches, and the height of the father in inches,
and outputs the estimated adult height of the child in inches. The program should allow the user to enter a new set of values and output the predicted height 
until the user decides to exit. The user should be able to input the heights in feet and inches, and the program should output the estimated height of 
the child in feet and inches. Use the int data type to store the heights.
